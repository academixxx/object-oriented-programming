Objective:
You will write a program that reverses the content of an array in place. This means the actual elements of the array must change position, not just how they are displayed.
Important Rules:
1.    You are not allowed to copy the elements into another array and then print them.
2.    You are not allowed to simply use a loop that prints the array elements from the last index to the first.
3.    The array itself must be updated so that its contents are reversed in memory.
Example:
Output
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 9
Enter a number: 2

Reversed order: 2, 9, 3, 7, 5.

(Notice: The first element (4) swapped with the last (5), and the second (7) swapped with the second-to-last (9).)
